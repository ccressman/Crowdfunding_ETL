# Crowdfunding_ETL
This repository houses code used to build a simple ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, Regex, and PostgreSQL. 

Specifically, this project uses Python, Pandas, and Regex to extract and transform data from a crowdfunding dataset and export new, cleaned datasets as four CSV files. These CSV files were used to create a SQL database using PostgreSQL.
